                Feel better now, feel better now<br>
                Here I go, here I go<br>
                It's better now, feel better now<br>
                Do you remember when we fell under?<br>
                Did you expect me to reason with thunder?<br>
                I still remember when time was frozen<br>
                What seemed forever was just a moment<br>
                Hurry up, hurry <br>
                There's no more waiting<br>
                We're still worth saving<br>
                Feel the light<br>
                Shining in the dark of night<br>
                Remember what we forgot<br>
                I know it's a long shot<br>
                But we're bringing it all back, we're bringing it all back<br>
                Feel the light<br>
                Shining like the stars tonight<br>
                Remember what we forgot<br>
                I know it's a long shot<br>
                But we're bringing it all back, we're bringing it all back<br>
                Here I go, here I go<br>
                Feel better now, feel better now<br>
                Here I go, here I go<br>
                It's better now, feel better now<br>
                I still remember when things were broken<br>
                But put together, the cracks will close in<br>
                Hurry up, hurry up<br>
                There's no more waiting<br>
                We're still worth saving<br>
                Feel the light<br>
                Shining in the dark of night<br>
                Remember what we forgot<br>
                I know it's a long shot<br>
                But we're bringing it all back, we're bringing it all back<br>
                Feel the light<br>
                Shining like the stars tonight<br>
                Remember what we forgot<br>
                I know it's a long shot<br>
                But we're bringing it all back, we're bringing it all back<br>
                You and I can have it all tonight<br>
                So let's bring it back it to light<br>
                Now we have another chance to fly<br>
                Another chance to make it right<br>
                Feel the light<br>
                Shining in the dark of night<br>
                Remember what we forgot<br>
                I know it's a long shot<br>
                Feel the light<br>
                Shining like the stars tonight<br>
                Remember what we forgot<br>
                I know it's a long shot<br>
                But we're bringing it all back, we're bringing it all back<br>
                Here we go, here we go<br>
                Feel better now, feel better now<br>
                Here we go, here we go<br>
                It's better now, feel better now</p></center>
