            <center><p>You must think that I'm stupid<br>
                You must think that I'm a fool<br>
                You must think that I'm new to this<br>
                But I have seen this all before<br>
                I'm never gonna let you close to me<br>
                Even though you mean the most to me<br>
                'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br>
                So, I'm never gonna get too close to you<br>
                Even when I mean the most to you<br>
                In case you go and leave me in the dirt<br>
                But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry<br>
                And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry<br>
                And every time you walk out, the less I love you<br>
                Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true<br>
                I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
                (I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
                I'm way too good at goodbyes<br>
                (I'm way too good at goodbyes)<br>
                I know you're thinking I'm heartless<br>
                I know you're thinking I'm cold<br>
                I'm just protecting my innocence<br>
                I'm just protecting my soul<br>
                I'm never gonna let you close to me<br>
                Even though you mean the most to me<br>
                'Cause every time I open up, it hurts<br>
                So, I'm never gonna get too close to you<br>
